# Child Ownership Verification Fix

## Problem

After tokens expire and a new guest session is created, the app crashes with a 404 error:

```
Child ID from storage: 1
‚ùå API Error 404: http://192.168.11.102:8000/api/children/1/dashboard/?range=7
```

### Why This Happens

1. **Guest User 3** completes onboarding ‚Üí Creates **Child ID 1**
2. App stores **Child ID 1** in AsyncStorage
3. **Tokens expire** (15 minutes)
4. App auto-creates **new guest session** ‚Üí **Guest User 4**
5. **Child ID 1** still in storage, but belongs to **Guest User 3**
6. API call to dashboard fails with **404** (permission denied)

### The Root Cause

Django's `ChildViewSet` has object-level permissions:

```python
permission_classes = [IsAuthenticated, IsChildOwner]

def get_queryset(self):
    return Child.objects.filter(parent=self.request.user)
```

When Guest User 4 tries to access Child ID 1:
- Django checks: "Does Child 1 belong to User 4?"
- Answer: NO (it belongs to User 3)
- Returns 404 for security (doesn't reveal child exists)

## Solution

Added **child ownership verification** on home screen load:

### Before (Broken):
```typescript
React.useEffect(() => {
  const id = await appStorage.getChildId();
  if (id) {
    setChildId(id);  // ‚ùå Blindly trusts stored ID
  }
}, []);
```

### After (Fixed):
```typescript
React.useEffect(() => {
  const id = await appStorage.getChildId();
  if (id) {
    // Verify ownership
    const children = await getChildren();  // GET /api/children/
    const childExists = children.results.some(c => c.id === id);

    if (childExists) {
      setChildId(id);  // ‚úÖ Child belongs to current user
    } else {
      // ‚ùå Child belongs to different user
      await appStorage.clearAppData();
      Alert.alert('Session expir√©e', 'Veuillez recommencer...');
      router.replace('/onboarding/age');
    }
  }
}, []);
```

## Console Output Examples

## Why This Happens in Guest Mode

**Guest sessions are ephemeral:**
- Each guest user gets unique JWT tokens
- Tokens expire after 15 minutes
- New guest session = new user ID = no children

**Storage is persistent:**
- AsyncStorage survives app restarts
- Child ID from old guest session remains
- Creates mismatch with new guest user

**The Fix:**
- Verify ownership on every app launch
- Clear orphaned child IDs
- Force fresh onboarding for new guest users

---

## Database State (Example)

```sql
-- Before token expiration
User ID 3 (guest) ‚Üí Child ID 1 ‚úÖ
AsyncStorage: child_id = 1

-- After token expiration + new session
User ID 3 (guest) ‚Üí Child ID 1 (old session, expired tokens)
User ID 4 (guest) ‚Üí No children (new session, active tokens)
AsyncStorage: child_id = 1 (orphaned!)

-- Result: 404 when User 4 tries to access Child 1
```

---

## Testing

### Test 1: Normal Flow (No Issues)
1. Complete onboarding
2. Close and reopen app immediately
3. **Expected:** Dashboard loads (tokens still valid)

### Test 2: Token Expiration
1. Complete onboarding
2. Wait 16+ minutes (or manually clear tokens)
3. Reopen app
4. **Expected:**
   - Alert: "Session expir√©e"
   - Redirects to onboarding
   - New guest user created
   - New child created

### Test 3: Manual Storage Corruption
1. Complete onboarding
2. Manually set wrong child ID in AsyncStorage
3. Reload app
4. **Expected:**
   - Logs: "Child ID X does NOT belong to current user"
   - Clears data, redirects to onboarding

## Alternative Solutions Considered

### ‚ùå Option 1: Persist Guest User Across Sessions
**Problem:** Requires storing guest user ID + tokens permanently
**Issue:** Security risk, violates guest session concept

### ‚ùå Option 2: Merge Child to New Guest User
**Problem:** Transfer child from old user to new user
**Issue:** Complex migration, data ownership issues

### ‚úÖ Option 3: Fresh Start (Current Solution)
**Benefit:** Clean slate, simple, secure
**Tradeoff:** User loses onboarding data if tokens expire

For a production app with full accounts, this issue doesn't exist because:
- User signs in with email/password
- Same user ID across sessions
- Children remain accessible

---

## Files Modified

- ‚úÖ `app/(authed)/home.tsx` - Added child ownership verification

---

## Summary

The app now:
1. ‚úÖ Verifies child ownership on load
2. ‚úÖ Detects mismatches (orphaned child IDs)
3. ‚úÖ Clears corrupted data automatically
4. ‚úÖ Guides user to restart onboarding
5. ‚úÖ Logs detailed debug info

This ensures **guest users always see their own children** and never get 404 errors from trying to access children they don't own.
